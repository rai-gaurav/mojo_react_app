Mojolicious ‚ù§ React 

This repo contains 2 ways by which you can use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) in your [Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/) app and create beautiful charts with [AmCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/)
1. With JSX (seperate client(React.js + Amcharts v4) and server(Mojolicious + OpenAPI + Apache + uWSGI + Docker))
2. Without JSX - Look at [README.md](without_jsx/README.md) for more details
